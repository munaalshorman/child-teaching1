                <p> Most people don't think about the process of learning to read until they decide to
                     start teaching their own children at home.<br>

                    Contrary to what some people believe, learning to read is not a 'natural' process that happens all on 
                    its own. It's a complex one that requires the proper teaching of various skills and strategies, 
                    such as phonics (knowing the relationship between letters and sounds) and phonemic awareness.
                        
                    The good news is that although reading itself is a complex process, the steps taken in order to
                    build these skills are fairly simple and straightforward. In order to teach kids how to read and
                    make it a positive and rewarding experience, try these simple and time?tested strategies below.

            <h2>How to teach writing</h2>
            <p>When your kid is first learning to write, it can be an exciting and frustrating time. However, 
                if you don't try too much too soon, it can be fun for you and your kid. Take some time to help 
                your child build muscles, then move on to gripping a crayon or a marker. You can also work on
                 fun letter games to get your child interested, and then work with marker and paper.
